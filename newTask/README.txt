"newTask" 

Feedforward-plus-PI Controller
Kp = 1.5
Ki = 0.1

Initial block: (1m, 1m, 0rad)
Final block: (-0.5m, 0.5m, -pi/2rad)


Joint limit is implemented for joint 3 to avoid self-collision and sigularity. 
For comparison, I also include the video and data for result without joint limit in the noJointLimit folder.
